This project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey, Mexico, comparing the concentrations of key atmospheric pollutants during 2020 (lockdown) and 2021 (post-lockdown). We apply multivariate statistical methods to data collected from three monitoring stations (north, center, south) and focus on PM10, CO, NO2, and O3 pollutants, considering meteorological factors as well.

## Project Summary

- **Objective:**  
  To determine whether there were significant differences in air quality between 2020 and 2021, identify relevant meteorological and emission factors, and understand the impact of both civil and industrial activities on pollution levels.

- **Dataset:**  
  Data from SIMA monitoring stations for 2020 and 2021, including 14 variables and over 52,000 records.

- **Main Analyses:**
  - Confidence intervals for mean comparisons (by year and station)
  - Multinomial logistic regression to study meteorological influences, especially on O3
  - Exploratory and statistical analysis to support findings with external and governmental data

## Folder and File Structure

- **Data preparation:**  
  Scripts and notebooks for cleaning, filling missing values, and transforming pollutant measurements according to Mexican health standards.

- **Statistical analysis:**  
  - Notebooks for confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression models.
  - Plots and results for each pollutant by station and year.


## How to Use

1. Download the final report and datasets from the provided links.
2. Follow the notebooks to reproduce data cleaning, statistical analysis, and model fitting.
3. Review the conclusions and recommendations for policymakers and the public.

## References

The project is based on data from SIMA and government sources, as well as international guidelines (WHO, UNEP) and recent literature on air pollution and COVID-19.
